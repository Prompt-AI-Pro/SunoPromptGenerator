Hey guys, with V4 on the horizon, I’m sure you guys are all madly writing lyrics for your upcoming Suno tracks! With that in mind, I’ve decided to share my personal songwriting prompt that I use for my own demos. It focuses on giving coherent, fresh, and cliche-free outputs that apply some writing craft while being customizable. It is tested on chatGPT 4o as well as o1-preview (which tends to a little better).

To get started, simply copy and paste the entire text below where it says prompt and fill in the 4 input fields at the top [then press enter :)]. 

It works off an idea and/or lyric title fragments. There’s plenty of customization for genre/structure/tone available with just the 4 input fields, but if you want to get more advanced you can add custom data to the cliches list to avoid specific images/phrases/metaphors/rhymes.

Feel free to use, and do share if you have any suggestions for improvement. Let’s make this prompt even better!

PROMPT:

Ultimate Songwriting Prompt - V1

Inputs

1. [IDEA/LYRIC FRAGMENTS]:
(Help text: Enter the core concept, snippets of lyrics, or both. Ideas do not need quotes. For example: A fleeting love affair. Fragments should be in quotes, e.g., “Her shadow fades in morning light.” You can combine ideas and fragments, e.g., A fleeting love affair and “catching whispers in the night.” If providing a title, include it in this field as Title: Your Title Here.) Input:

2. [GENRE]:
(Help text: Define the genre. For example: pop, indie rock, folk, R&B.) Input:

3. [STRUCTURE]:
(Help text: Define the song structure. For example: Verse/Chorus/Verse/Chorus/Bridge/Chorus, or Verse/Pre-Chorus/Chorus.) Input:

4. [TONE]:
(Help text: Provide tone guidance. For example: hopeful, melancholic, defiant, nostalgic.) Input:

Rules for Songwriting Output

[1. STORY DEPTH] Build a coherent narrative or vignettes around the [IDEA]. Use cause-and-effect storytelling (what happened and why). Include stakes—universal and relatable themes (e.g., love, self-discovery, loss).

[2. SECTION CONTRAST] Ensure the chorus contrasts rhythmically and emotionally from the verses. Contrast syllable counts between sections to create dynamic flow. Make the chorus a cathartic release that grows in impact with each repetition.

[3. RHYME SCHEME] Avoid cliche rhymes unless reimagined. Use perfect rhymes sparingly; include family rhyme, additive/subtractive rhyme, or assonance for freshness.

[4. SHOW, DON’T TELL] Use vivid sensory details, not abstract or generic language. Employ metaphors, similes, and literary devices sparingly and intentionally.

[5. CHORUS DYNAMICS] Keep chorus lyrics consistent across repetitions. Build emotional resonance in the chorus through the preceding sections.

[6. CREATIVITY CONSTRAINTS] Do NOT use cliches from the reference lists below unless reimagined. Include at least one novel, memorable image that stands out without being overly obscure.

[7. TITLE] If a title is not provided in [IDEA/LYRIC FRAGMENTS], generate a fitting title based on the concept or lyrics.

[8. FORMAT] Use square brackets for section headers ([Verse 1], [Chorus], etc.). Start each section tag on a new line, followed by the lines of lyrics with a return break between sections.

Output Format

[1. LYRICS]: Include three verses, one chorus (with an optional hook), and one bridge. Follow the [STRUCTURE] and [GENRE] specified. Use square brackets for sections, e.g., [Verse 1], [Chorus]. Leave a blank line before each section tag.

Characters and Setting: Briefly describe key characters and settings. Mood/Sub-Genre Tags: Use descriptors like “wistful” or “synth-driven pop.”

Add this to the prompt before your generation process. It'll allow the model to do some reasoning in terms of what it's generating instead of just spitting out a song. If you want the models to think, you can usually achieve something that performs pretty close to o1 by just directing a model to write their thought process within tags, before generating the output.

Before you begin writing, plan your approach inside <songwriting_process> tags. Follow these steps:

Analyze the genre, structure, and tone. How do these elements inform your lyrical choices? Quote key phrases from each element.

2. Identify and quote key phrases from the idea/lyric fragments that will shape your song.

3. Develop a central theme or story based on the idea/lyric fragments. What emotions or experiences will you explore?

4. Brainstorm 3-5 potential titles based on the theme and key phrases. Number each title.

5. Consider the contrast between verses and chorus. How will you make each section distinct yet cohesive?

6. List 5-7 unique metaphors, similes, or imagery that fit the theme without resorting to clichés. Number each item.

7. Plan your rhyme scheme, incorporating various types of rhymes to add depth and interest. Here's a brief explanation of rhyme types to consider:

- Perfect rhyme: Identical sounds (e.g., "light" and "night")
- Slant rhyme: Similar but not identical sounds (e.g., "love" and "move")
- Internal rhyme: Rhymes within a single line (e.g., "The cat in the hat sat on the mat")
- Assonance: Repetition of vowel sounds (e.g., "light" and "fire")
- Consonance: Repetition of consonant sounds (e.g., "pitter-patter")

8. Map out the emotional journey of the song, noting how feelings might change from verse to chorus to bridge.

9. List potential challenges in adhering to the genre conventions while avoiding clichés.
